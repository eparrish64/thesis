\chapter{Topological Cluster Data-MC Comparisons} \label{app:datamc}

In addition to the comparisons shown in the body of the work, the full set of comparisons between data and \gls{MC} for the topo-cluster variables used as inputs to the models presented are shown here. The number of topo-clusters is shown for unconverted photons in Figure \ref{fig:dmc-u-ntopo}, and in Figure \ref{fig:dmc-c-ntopo} for converted photons.

The distributions for $\sqrt{\lambda_{0}^2}$ and $\sqrt{r_{0}^2}$ for unconverted photons is shown in Section \ref{ssec:yid-datamc}. The centroid depth, isolation, and \gls{EM} probability of the leading topo-cluster for unconverted photons are shown in Figures \ref{fig:dmc-u-cl}, \ref{fig:dmc-u-iso}, and \ref{fig:dmc-u-emp}, respectively. For converted photons, the leading topo-cluster $\sqrt{\lambda_{0}^2}$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dmc-c-sl}, $\sqrt{r_{0}^2}$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dmc-c-sr}, centroid depth is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dmc-c-cl}, isolation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dmc-c-iso}, and \gls{EM} probability is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dmc-c-emp}. Plots are binned according to the \pt and $\eta$ bins used in the photon ID menu.

In general, the \gls{MC} models the unconverted photons well, with the exception of the isolation, particularly in the most central bin and beyond the crack. For converted photons, $\sqrt{r_{0}^2}$ modeling differs between data and \gls{MC}, and isolation differs considerably, particularly in the most central bin. On average converted photons have more topo-clusters per photon object, meaning they suffer more from cluster splitting, which influences these effects.
