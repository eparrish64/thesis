\section{Analysis Overview}

Previous results were presented with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ representing ATLAS dataset in 2015 and 2016 \cite{HIGG-2016-15}, and were consistent with Standard Model expectations. The non-resonant analysis set an observed (expected) 95\% CL upper limit on the $HH$ cross-section of 0.73 (0.93) pb, corresponding to 22 (28) times the SM prediction. This Higgs trilinear coupling is constrained between $-8.2 < \kappa_\lambda < 13.2$ at 95\% CL ($-8.3 < \kappa_\lambda < 13.2$ expected). The resonant analysis presented within the context of a narrow width scalar coupling to the di-Higgs system as a function of $m_X$. The observed (expected) limits are between 1.1 pb (0.9 pb) and 0.12 pb (0.15 pb) over the range of $\unit{260}{\GeV} < m_X < \unit{1000}{\GeV}$.

\section{Data and Simulated Samples}


\subsection{Data}

The analysis presented uses $pp$ collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015 and 2016, the first half of ``Run 2.'' After detector and data quality requirements, the total collected data corresponds to 36.1 \ifb. The loose diphoton trigger is used for this search, \texttt{HLT\_g35\_loose\_g25\_loose}, which triggers on diphoton events where the leading (subleading) photon \pt is greater than 35\% (25\%) the diphoton invariant mass.

\subsection{Simulated Samples}

Simulation is generated as outlined in Chapter \ref{ch:eventreco} in order to compare prediction to data. Independent samples are made for the considered signal hypotheses, as well as for the predominant backgrounds.

\subsubsection{Signal Samples}

This analysis considers two signals sources: \gls{SM} non-resonant di-Higgs production and resonant di-Higgs production through a scalar resonance.

\noindent\textbf{Non-resonant \gls{SM} Signal Samples}\\
\indent The non-resonant di-Higgs signal sample corresponding to \gls{SM} \gls{ggF} \hh production is generated at \gls{NLO} in \gls{QCD} through an \gls{EFT}.

\noindent\textbf{Non-resonant Varied \klambda Signal Samples}\\
\indent Samples for non-resonant di-Higgs production with varied \klambda were generated at values $\klambda = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 6, \pm 10$. These samples were generated at \gls{LO}, then reweighted to \gls{NNLO} through a $K$-factor, taking the ratio of the cross-sections of the FT\textsubscript{approx} \gls{SM} non-resonant signal sample (at \gls{NNLO}) and the $\klambda =1$ sample (at \gls{LO}).

For generic \klambda, an interpolation function can be used to predict the amplitude, and thus the signal yield. The amplitude can be written as

\begin{equation}
  A(k_t,\klambda) = k_t^2 B + k_t \klambda T
\end{equation}

Where $B$ is the contribution from the box diagram (with two $th$ vertices, thus squared), $T$ is the contribution from the trilinear diagram (containing one $th$ and one $hhh$ vertex). If we square this amplitude and vary \klambda (consider values 0, 1, and 10),

\begin{align}
  &|A(k_t,\klambda)|^2 = k_t^4 |B|^2 + k_t^2\klambda^2 |T|^2 + k_t^3\klambda(B^*T + BT^*)\\
  &|A(1,0)|^2 = |B|^2\\
  &|A(1,1)|^2 = |B|^2 + |T|^2 + (B^*T + BT^*)\\
  &|A(1,10)|^2 = |B|^2 + 100|T|^2 + 10(B^*T + BT^*)
\end{align}

We can then combine these equations to express the squared amplitude in terms of the amplitudes of the varied reference samples
\begin{equation}
  |A(k_t,\klambda)|^2 = k_t^2 \left[ 
    \frac{90 k_t^2 + 9\klambda^2 - 99k_t\klambda}{90}|A(1,0)|^2 +
    \frac{100 k_t\klambda - 10\klambda^2}{90}|A(1,1)|^2 +
    \frac{\klambda^2 - k_t\klambda}{90}|A(1,1)|^2 \right]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Background Samples}

The dominant background in this analysis are the non-resonant \myy continuum events. Additionally, mono-Higgs boson production is a subdominant background to this analysis. 

\noindent\textbf{\yy-Continuum}\\
\indent

\noindent\textbf{mono-Higgs Production}\\
\indent The following mono-Higgs production channels are considered: gluon-gluon fusion ($ggH$), vector-boson fusion ($VBF\ H$) Z-associated production ($ZH$), W-associated production ($WH$), single and top quark pair associated production ($tH$ and \tth, respectively), and bottom quark pair associated production ($b\bar{b}H$).

\section{Object Definition}
\subsection{Photons}

Selected photons for this analysis are converted or unconverted photons which pass tight ID cuts (outlined in Section \ref{ssec:em-signatures}). Photons must have $\pt > \unit{25}{\GeV}$ and $\abseta < 2.37$. Additionally, the crack region of $1.37 < \abseta < 1.52$ is rejected.

Photons must pass an ambiguity tool is used to differentiate overlapping photons and electrons \cite{r1-photonID}.

The leading photon \pt distribution is shown in Figure \ref{fig:photon_l_pt}, the subleading is shown in Figure \ref{fig:photon_s_pt}.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Jets}

Jets are defined using the \antikt algorithm with $R=0.4$, using jets with energy corrected for pile-up effects and direction readjusted to the primary vertex (EM-JES jets). Jets considered must have $\pt > \unit{25}{\GeV}$ and be within the tagging region, $\abseta < 2.5$. The following additional requirements are applied\footnote{This selection is similar to that of the default jet selection for ATLAS $H\rightarrow \yy$ analyses. The $\abseta < 2.5$ is an additional requirement imposed atop that selection for b-tagging.}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Jets with $\pt < \unit{50}{\GeV}$ and $\abseta < 2.4$ must pass the ``default'' \gls{JVT} requirement, with $|\text{JVT}| \geq 0.59$ \cite{JVT}.
  \item Events that contain a jet passing the ``LooseBad'' cut are vetoed. 
  \item Jets with $\Dr < 0.4$ from a tight, isolated photon are vetoed.
  \item Jets with $\Dr < 0.2$ from a selected electron are vetoed.
\end{itemize}



Following this selection, candidate jets are selected in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In the 0-tag control region, the two leading jets are the candidate jets.
  \item In the 1-tag region, one of the jets is the b-tagged jet, the other is selected via a \gls{BDT}
  \item In the 2-tag region, the two b-tagged jets are the candidate jets.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}



\section{Event Selection}
\noindent\textbf{Preselection}\\
\indent For all samples, a preselection common to all \Hgg analyses is applied \cite{hgam-preselection}. To target this decay, events must pass the diphoton trigger, which requires two photons passing \textit{loose} identification. One of which must have $\et > \unit{35}{GeV}$ and the other must have $\et > \unit{25}{GeV}$. Nominally, this is the \path{g35_loose_g25_loose} trigger. After this trigger requirement, \pt cuts are applied, requiring the leading (subleading) photon \pt to be greater than 35\% (25\%) the diphoton invariant mass. Additionally the diphoton invariant mass must be in the window of 105 to 160 GeV.

A further requirement of two jets within the \btagging region ($\abseta <2.5$) is added to the preselection in order to target the \Hbb decay.

\noindent\textbf{Signal Selection}\\
\indent In addition to the preselection requirements, events are selected into 1 and 2-tag signal regions based on \btagging criteria. The 2-tag signal region requires exactly two jets passing the 70\% efficient \btagging \gls{WP}. If an event fails this requirement, but has one \bjet passing the 60\% efficient \btagging \gls{WP}, it is added to the 1-tag signal region.

Events with 3 jets passing the 70\% efficient \btagging \gls{WP} are vetoed from this analysis in order to maintain orthogonality with the $HH \rightarrow \bb \bb$ analysis.


\section{Modeling}



\subsection{Non-resonant Analysis}
\subsubsection{Signal Modeling}

A double-sided Crystal Ball function \cite{dscb-diphoton}, a Gaussian core with power-law tails, is used to describe the shape of the \hhyybb signal. Model parameters are taken from the simulated signal sample.

\subsubsection{Background Modeling} \label{sssec:nonres-bkg-model}

The background for the non-resonant analysis is composed of a model for the smoothly-falling \yy continuum, and a model for single Higgs boson production. 


The fit function is selected through a \textit{spurious signal} test, which evaluates . This test performs signal-plus-background fits to just the simulated background, evaluating the extracted signal in the $\unit{121}{\GeV} < \myy < \unit{129}{\GeV}$ window, which is taken as the bias. This procedure is repeated for each considered function, and the function with the fewest spurious signal events is selected as the background function. If functions have the same bias, then by an Occam's Razor argument, the function with fewer free parameters is selected.

The considered functions for this test are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Exponential, consider orders $N=1,2,3$. Generalized form: $Exp^N (\myy ; \theta^{bkg}) = exp(\sum\limits_{j=0}^{N} \theta_j^{bkg} \dot m_{\gamma\gamma}^j)$
  \item Bernstein, consider orders $N=3,4,5$. Generalized form: $Bernstein^N (\myy ; \theta^{bkg}) = \sum\limits_{j=0}^{N} \theta_j^{bkg} b_{j,N}$, for $b_{j,N} = C_n^i x^j (1-x)^{N-j}$, where $x= (\myy-100)/60$
  \item Dijet of form: $dijet(\myy ; \theta^{bkg}) = \theta_1^{bkg} (1-\myy)^{\theta_2^{bkg}} m_{\gamma\gamma}^{\theta_3^{bkg}}$
\end{itemize}

Through this test, the first-order exponential function is found to have the lowest bias, and is selected as the \yy continuum background model.

The single Higgs boson background is modeled through a double-sided Crystal Ball function, where parameters are taken from simulation.

\subsection{Resonant Analysis}
\subsubsection{Signal Modeling}

For the resonant analysis, the signal is modeled by a function using a gaussian core, with exponential tails, known as \texttt{ExpGaussExp}\footnote{Also, ``double-shouldered GaussExp''} \cite{exp-gauss-exp}. This function is fit in a window around the mass hypothesis. %TODO: More here


\subsubsection{Background Modeling}

A spurious signal test (described in Section \ref{sssec:nonres-bkg-model}) is performed

For the loose selection in the low mass region, a Novosibirsk function \cite{novosibirsk} is selected, which has the generalized form:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  P(x) &= exp(-0.5^{ln(q_y)^2 / \Lambda^2 + \Lambda^2})\\
  \text{with,} \quad \quad q_{y} &= 1 + \Lambda(x-x_0)/\sigma \times \frac{\sinh(\Lambda \sqrt{\ln(4)})}{\Lambda \sqrt{\ln(4)}}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

The Novosibirsk function features a peak at low value, followed by a smoothly falling tail. For the tight selection, used in the high mass region, an exponential function is selected.

\section{Systematic Uncertainties}
\section{Results}

\subsection{Limits on Non-Resonant Production}

The tight selection is used in the non-resonant analysis to set a 95\% \gls{CL} upper limit on non-resonant \gls{ggF} Higgs boson pair production. The observed and expected limits are shown Table \ref{tab:nonresonant_results_SM} in both absolute value and as a multiple of the \gls{SM} production cross-section. The observed $\pm 1\sigma$ values are shown as well. This upper limit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:limits-nonresonant}.

\subsection{Limits on Resonant Production}

The 95\% \gls{CL} limits on resonant di-Higgs production are shown in Figure \ref{fig:limits-resonant}. This limit uses the loose selection at $m_{X} \leq \unit{500}{\GeV}$ and the tight selection at $m_{X} \geq \unit{500}{\GeV}$. No significance excesses are found. Expected exclusion limits range from 1.14 pb to 0.12 pb, observed limits range from 0.90 pb to 0.15 pb.

\section{Searches for Vector Boson Fusion HH Production}

To improve this analysis, a signal model for the Vector Boson Fusion production mode has been designed and will be implemented into this analysis using the full ``Run 2'' dataset. This signal model is integrated into the analysis through a separate analysis category that is enriched in VBF events, defined via cuts on multiclass \gls{BDT} scores.

\subsection{Simulated Samples}

\subsubsection{Non-resonant VBF HH Samples}

The signal MC samples for VBF $HH$ production are generated at LO using \MGMCatNLO 2.6.0, using cards presented in \cite{vbfhh}. The process generated is $pp \rightarrow HHqq$. The dominant production in this sample is VBF $HH$ production, but contains contributions from $VHH$  hadronic and Higgsstrahlung production. The NNPDF 2.3 LO PDF set \cite{NNPDF} is used in the matrix element, interfaced to \HERWIG 7.0.4 using the H7-UE-MMHT tune for underlying events and the H7-MMHT2014LO tune for parton shower and hadronization.

Samples have been produced for the various coupling values shown in Table \ref{tab:vbf-coupling-samples}. The values of $\kappa_\lambda$,$c_{2V}$, and $c_{v}$ are all 1 in the SM. The values selected for production aim to vary each coupling value enough that interpolation may be performed, and one value was produced near where limits could be expected to be set ($\kappa_\lambda = 10$ and $c_{2V}=4$).

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
        $\kappa_\lambda$ & $c_{2V}$ & $c_{v}$ \\
        \hline
        1 & 0 & 0.5 \\
        1 & 1 & 0.5 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 \\

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Grid of coupling values used in production of VBF $HH$ samples.}
    \label{tab:vbf-coupling-samples}
\end{table}

Relevant distributions for validation of these samples can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:vbf-mc-validation}. Plots are shown at parton level, with a basic jet selection applied to isolate the VBF jets similar to that done at reconstruction level. Jets are considered if they have $\pt > 25$, then the $m_{bb}$ pair is selected as the two jets with $m_{bb}$ closest to 125 \GeV. The VBF jets are selected as the highest $m_{jj}$ pair after removing jets used in the $m_{bb}$ pairing. Additional detail on the validation for these samples is outlined in Ref. \cite{mc-validation}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Event Selection} \label{ssec:vbf-event-selection}
Events which have already passed the ggF BDT based selection and have at least 4 jets are considered for the VBF candidate. The 4 jet requirement is imposed in order to reconstruct VBF-based variables. The VBF jets are then selected as the highest $m_{jj}$ pairing, excluding $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ candidate jets.

These events are then evaluated by a multiclass BDT, which has independent classes for VBF HH, ggF HH, $\gamma \gamma$-continuum, and $ttH$. Ultimately, an event selected for the VBF category if it passes the BDT score threshold for VBF HH, and fails the score threshold for the other three classes. The thresholds are determined by a 4-dimensional scan over cuts on the BDT score, with the Asimov significance as the figure of merit.

A flowchart of this logic is shown in Figure \ref{fig:vbf-logic}.

A set of 26 variables were considered for this BDT, listed in Appendix \ref{app:vbf-variables}. Broadly, they describe the kinematics of various physics objects in the event, as well as event shape \cite{STDM-2011-33} variables and variables to reconstruct the W-mass, which are useful for suppression of the ttH background.

For dimensionality reduction, a pruning procedure was performed.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item To remove redundant variables, those with a pearson correlation value above 0.85 were removed. This brought the list from 26 to 19, pruning several event shape variables.
  \item After pruning those variables and retraining, low-impact variables were removed. The pearson correlation for each variable to the 4 class BDT probability distributions were calculated. Those 4 correlation values were summed, and variables with a sum less than 1.0 were pruned. This brought the set from 19 to 11 input variables.
  \item At 11 input variables, the number of possible combinations of variables has vastly simplified, so every possible variable subset was considered, with a depth optimization procedure performed with each retraining. The minimal subset of variables which did not impact the final significance was selected as the final inputs.
\end{enumerate}

After this pruning procedure, the X final inputs were:

\textbf{VBF-targeted:}

\textbf{$\gamma \gamma$-suppressing:}

\textbf{$ttH$-suppressing:}



Distributions for each these variables after applying a 4-jet requirement can be found in Appendix \ref{app:vbf-variables}.

Adding a VBF-enriched category provides a XXX percent improvement over not defining such a category.
