\chapter{Search for di-Higgs Production in the \texorpdfstring{$\gamma\gamma b\bar{b}$}{yybb} Channel}
\section{Analysis Overview}

Previous results were presented with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ representing ATLAS dataset in 2015 and 2016 \cite{HIGG-2016-15}, and were consistent with Standard Model expectations. The non-resonant analysis set an observed (expected) 95\% CL upper limit on the $HH$ cross-section of 0.73 (0.93) pb, corresponding to 22 (28) times the SM prediction. This Higgs trilinear coupling is constrained between $-8.2 < \kappa_\lambda < 13.2$ at 95\% CL ($-8.3 < \kappa_\lambda < 13.2$ expected). The resonant analysis presented within the context of a narrow width scalar coupling to the di-Higgs system as a function of $m_X$. The observed (expected) limits are between 1.1 pb (0.9 pb) and 0.12 pb (0.15 pb) over the range of $\unit{260}{\GeV} < m_X < \unit{1000}{\GeV}$.

\section{Data and Simulated Samples}


\subsection{Data}

The analysis presented uses $pp$ collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC during ``Run 2,'' which ran from 2015 through 2018. After detector and data quality requirements, the total collected data corresponds to 139 \ifb. The loose diphoton trigger is used for this search, \texttt{HLT\_g35\_loose\_g25\_loose}, which triggers on diphoton events where the leading (subleading) photon \pt is greater than 35\% (25\%) the diphoton invariant mass.

\subsection{Simulated Samples}

This analysis searches for both non-resonant and resonant di-Higgs production, considering signal contributions from the ggF and VBF production modes.


\section{Object Definition}
\subsection{Photons}

Selected photons for this analysis are converted or unconverted photons which pass tight ID cuts (outlined in Section \ref{ssec:em-signatures}). Photons must have $\pt > \unit{25}{\GeV}$ and $\abseta < 2.37$. Additionally, the crack region of $1.37 < \abseta < 1.52$ is rejected.

Photons must pass an ambiguity tool is used to differentiate overlapping photons and electrons \cite{r1-photonID}.

The leading photon \pt distribution is shown in Figure \ref{fig:photon_l_pt}, the subleading is shown in Figure \ref{fig:photon_s_pt}.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Jets}

Jets are defined using the \antikt algorithm with $R=0.4$, using jets with energy corrected for pile-up effects and direction readjusted to the primary vertex (EM-JES jets). Jets considered must have $\pt > \unit{25}{\GeV}$ and be within the tagging region, $\abseta < 2.5$. The following additional requirements are applied\footnote{This selection is similar to that of the default jet selection for ATLAS $H\rightarrow \yy$ analyses. The $\abseta < 2.5$ is an additional requirement imposed atop that selection for b-tagging.}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Jets with $\pt < \unit{50}{\GeV}$ and $\abseta < 2.4$ must pass the ``default'' \gls{JVT} requirement, with $|\text{JVT}| \geq 0.59$ \cite{JVT}.
  \item Events that contain a jet passing the ``LooseBad'' cut are vetoed. 
  \item Jets with $\Dr < 0.4$ from a tight, isolated photon are vetoed.
  \item Jets with $\Dr < 0.2$ from a selected electron are vetoed.
\end{itemize}



Following this selection, candidate jets are selected in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In the 0-tag control region, the two leading jets are the candidate jets.
  \item In the 1-tag region, one of the jets is the b-tagged jet, the other is selected via a \gls{BDT}
  \item In the 2-tag region, the two b-tagged jets are the candidate jets.
\end{itemize}

\section{Event Selection}
\noindent\textbf{Preselection}\\
\indent For all samples, a preselection common to all \Hgg analyses is applied \cite{hgam-preselection}. To target this decay, events must pass the diphoton trigger, which requires two photons passing \textit{loose} identification. One of which must have $\et > \unit{35}{GeV}$ and the other must have $\et > \unit{25}{GeV}$. Nominally, this is the \path{g35_loose_g25_loose} trigger. After this trigger requirement, \pt cuts are applied, requiring the leading (subleading) photon \pt to be greater than 35\% (25\%) the diphoton invariant mass. Additionally the diphoton invariant mass must be in the window of 105 to 160 GeV.

A further requirement of two jets within the b-tagging region ($\abseta <2.5$) is added to the preselection in order to target the \Hbb decay.

\subsection{Limits on Non-Resonant Production}

The tight selection is used in the non-resonant analysis to set a 95\% \gls{CL} upper limit on non-resonant \gls{ggF} Higgs boson pair production. The observed and expected limits are shown Table \ref{tab:nonresonant_results_SM} in both absolute value and as a multiple of the \gls{SM} production cross-section. The observed $\pm 1\sigma$ values are shown as well. This upper limit is shown in Figure \ref{limits-nonresonant}.

\subsection{Limits on Resonant Production}

The 95\% \gls{CL} limits on resonant di-Higgs production are shown in Figure \ref{fig:limits-resonant}. This limit uses the loose selection at $m_{X} \leq \unit{500}{\GeV}$ and the tight selection at $m_{X} \geq \unit{500}{\GeV}$. No significance excesses are found. Expected exclusion limits range from 1.14 pb to 0.12 pb, observed limits range from 0.90 pb to 0.15 pb.

\section{Searches for Vector Boson Fusion HH Production}

To improve this analysis, a signal model for the Vector Boson Fusion production mode has been designed and will be implemented into this analysis using the full ``Run 2'' dataset. This signal model is integrated into the analysis through a separate analysis category that is enriched in VBF events, defined via cuts on multiclass \gls{BDT} scores.

\subsection{Simulated Samples}

\subsubsection{Non-resonant VBF HH Samples}

The signal MC samples for VBF $HH$ production are generated at LO using \MGMCatNLO 2.6.0, using cards presented in \cite{vbfhh}. The process generated is $pp \rightarrow HHqq$. The dominant production in this sample is VBF $HH$ production, but contains contributions from $VHH$  hadronic and Higgsstrahlung production. The NNPDF 2.3 LO PDF set \cite{NNPDF} is used in the matrix element, interfaced to \HERWIG 7.0.4 using the H7-UE-MMHT tune for underlying events and the H7-MMHT2014LO tune for parton shower and hadronization.

Samples have been produced for the various coupling values shown in Table \ref{tab:vbf-coupling-samples}. The values of $\kappa_\lambda$,$c_{2V}$, and $c_{v}$ are all 1 in the SM. The values selected for production aim to vary each coupling value enough that interpolation may be performed, and one value was produced near where limits could be expected to be set ($\kappa_\lambda = 10$ and $c_{2V}=4$).

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
        $\kappa_\lambda$ & $c_{2V}$ & $c_{v}$ \\
        \hline
        1 & 0 & 0.5 \\
        1 & 1 & 0.5 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 \\
        1 & 0 & 1 \\
        1 & 0.5 & 1 \\
        1 & 0 & 0.5 \\
        1 & 1 & 1 \\
        1 & 1.5 & 1 \\
        1 & 2 & 1 \\
        1 & 4 & 1 \\
        0 & 1 & 1 \\
        2 & 1 & 1 \\
        10 & 1 & 1 \\
        1 & 1 & 1.5
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Grid of coupling values used in production of VBF $HH$ samples.}
    \label{tab:vbf-coupling-samples}
\end{table}

Relevant distributions for validation of these samples can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:vbf-mc-validation}. Plots are shown at parton level, with a basic jet selection applied to isolate the VBF jets similar to that done at reconstruction level. Jets are considered if they have $\pt > 25$, then the $m_{bb}$ pair is selected as the two jets with $m_{bb}$ closest to 125 \GeV. The VBF jets are selected as the highest $m_{jj}$ pair after removing jets used in the $m_{bb}$ pairing. Additional detail on the validation for these samples is outlined in Ref. \cite{mc-validation}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Event Selection} \label{ssec:vbf-event-selection}
Events which have already passed the ggF BDT based selection and have at least 4 jets are considered for the VBF candidate. The 4 jet requirement is imposed in order to reconstruct VBF-based variables. The VBF jets are then selected as the highest $m_{jj}$ pairing, excluding $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ candidate jets.

These events are then evaluated by a multiclass BDT, which has independent classes for VBF HH, ggF HH, $\gamma \gamma$-continuum, and $ttH$. Ultimately, an event selected for the VBF category if it passes the BDT score threshold for VBF HH, and fails the score threshold for the other three classes. The thresholds are determined by a 4-dimensional scan over cuts on the BDT score, with the Asimov significance as the figure of merit.

A flowchart of this logic is shown in Figure \ref{fig:vbf-logic}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{chapters/chapter5_yybb/images/vbf_logic.png}
    \caption{Logic flow for an event to be selected into the VBF-enriched signal region. The starting set of candidates (denoted ``event'') requires passing preselection and at least one of the ggF-based signal categories. If an event is assigned to the ggF categories, it is separated into 4 categories.}
    \label{fig:vbf-logic}
\end{figure}


\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
	\hline
	Class & Target & Selection Logic  \\
	\hline
	0 & VBF HH & $BDTscore_{0} > XXX $ \\
	1 & ggF HH & $BDTscore_{1} < XXX $ \\
	2 & $\gamma\gamma$-Continuum &  $BDTscore_{2} < XXX $ \\
	3 & $ttH$ &  $BDTscore_{3} < XXX $ \\
	\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}


A set of 26 variables were considered for this BDT, listed in Appendix \ref{app:vbf-variables}. Broadly, they describe the kinematics of various physics objects in the event, as well as event shape \cite{STDM-2011-33} variables and variables to reconstruct the W-mass, which are useful for suppression of the ttH background.

For dimensionality reduction, a pruning procedure was performed.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item To remove redundant variables, those with a pearson correlation value above 0.85 were removed. This brought the list from 26 to 19, pruning several event shape variables.
  \item After pruning those variables and retraining, low-impact variables were removed. The pearson correlation for each variable to the 4 class BDT probability distributions were calculated. Those 4 correlation values were summed, and variables with a sum less than 1.0 were pruned. This brought the set from 19 to 11 input variables.
  \item At 11 input variables, the number of possible combinations of variables has vastly simplified, so every possible variable subset was considered, with a depth optimization procedure performed with each retraining. The minimal subset of variables which did not impact the final significance was selected as the final inputs.
\end{enumerate}

After this pruning procedure, the X final inputs were:

\textbf{VBF-targeted:}

\textbf{$\gamma \gamma$-suppressing:}

\textbf{$ttH$-suppressing:}



Distributions for each these variables after applying a 4-jet requirement can be found in Appendix \ref{app:vbf-variables}.

Adding a VBF-enriched category provides a XXX percent improvement over not defining such a category.
