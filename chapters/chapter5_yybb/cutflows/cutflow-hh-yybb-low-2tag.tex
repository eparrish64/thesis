\caption[Cutflow for non-resonant \hhyybb, 2 tag category (low mass selection)]{Cutflow for non-resonant \hhyybb, 2 tag category (low mass selection). Cuts are applied successively from top to bottom. The ``yield'' is in number of events, the error is the absolute error on number of events, and the efficiency presented is the absolute efficiency. From top to bottom, the cuts are as follows: Number of events in the original file ($N_{xAOD}$), number of events in the derivation ($N_{DxAOD}$), total events code, events after duplicate removal, events in the \gls{GRL}, events passing diphoton trigger requirements, events passing detector data quality cuts, events with a primary vertex selected, events with 2 photons, events that pass the $e-\gamma$ ambiguity requirements, events that pass trigger matching, events meeting photon isolation criteria, events passing relative \pt thresholds, events within the [105, 160] GeV \myy window defined, events with 2 central jets, events passing $b$-tagging requirements, events where the $b$ jets meet criteria, events passing the \mbb criteria, and last, events in the 120-130 GeV \yy signal region. The last cut is not used for the non-resonant analysis. Cuts through the \myy window are the standardized $H \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$ preselection.}
