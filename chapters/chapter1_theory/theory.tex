\chapter{Theory}
    In this chapter, the theoretical motivation of a search for \HpLong is described. Firstly, a review of the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) is laid out, then a brief overview of Supersymmetry focusing on the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) Higgs sector is detailed. Finally, the Type II 2-Higgs Doublet Model's (2HDM) relation to the \Hp production cross section and subsequent branching ratio into SM particles is described as motivation for the choice of studying \HpLong.

\section{The Standard Model}
	The Standard Model of particle physics is a mathematical model that describes all known matter and forces. The Standard Model is built upon a gauge group of type $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$. The $SU(3)_C$ term dictates the strong interaction while the $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ term describes the electroweak interaction. These interactions occur between fundamental particles called fermions that comprise the known matter of the universe. The interactions, or forces, are mediated by fundamental particles called bosons. 

	\subsection{Particles}        
		The particles that make up the Standard Model are separated into two groups according to their intrinsic angular momentum charge, or spin. Fermions are those that carry half-integer spin while Bosons carry full integer spin values.

		\subsubsection{Fermions}	
		Fermions are even further divided into two groups, quarks and leptons. The quarks participate in the strong interaction via their color charge. Quarks cannot exist as a singular particle and thus combine into hadrons. Leptons carry no color charge and therefore do not participate in strong force interactions. The fermions in the standard model all participate in the electroweak interaction. However, the electromagnetic interaction is limited to those fermions that carry an electromagnetic charge.

		Fermions can then be split further into three generations, each lepton has a weak force partner in the form of a neutrino.

	\subsection{Interactions}

		At its core, the SM relies upon symmetries. From these symmetries, conservation laws follow. It is these laws of conservation, and the breaking of said symmetries,  that dictate the allowed interactions of matter. The first, being a symmetry under charge conjugation, mirror reflection, and time reversal is known as CPT symmetry. The symmetry between charge conjugation and mirror reflection (CP) can be broken in certain circumstances, but holds in strong and electromagnetic interactions. This breaking of CP symmetry occurs in the weak interaction and implies a non-symmetry between matter and antimatter. Since this symmetry holds for strong and electromagnetic interactions, baryon number $(B = \frac{1}{3}(n_{q} - n_{\bar{q}}) )$ and lepton number are conserved in SM interactions. Lepton generation number \footnote{Ignoring neutrino oscillations}, electric charge, color charge, 4-momentum ($p=(E,\vec{p})$), and angular momentum are all conserved in the SM.
