\chapter{Theory}

    Humans have been concerned with the fundamental nature and constituents of matter since as early as sixth century BC, when philosophers such as Democritus and Leucippus first proposed indivisible building blocks of nature known as ``atoms'' \cite{democritus}. It wasn't until Dalton in the nineteenth century when scientific modeling of the particle nature began to take shape \cite{dalton}. Fundamental advances on the nature of atoms were made over the next centuries by Mendeleev, Thomson, Rutherford, amongst others. Over the course of the 1900s, particle theory advanced rapidly and many particles were discovered forming what was known as the ``particle zoo.'' In order to classify these particles, Gell-Mann and Zweig proposed the quark model in 1964 \cite{quark-model}. In the 1970s Glashow, Weinberg, and Salam put forth electroweak theory, which gave a model for vector bosons, leading to successful mass predictions of the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons confirmed at \gls{CERN} in 1983 \cite{w-discovery, z-discovery}. The \glsfirst{SM} was . It remains our best model for describing fundamental particles and their interactions\footnote{While the \gls{SM} has been extraordinarily successful in providing experimental predictions, it has several known shortcomings. Notably, the \gls{SM} only explains 3 of the 4 fundamental forces, the exception being gravitation. It does not have an explanation of dark energy or a dark matter candidate. Neutrino flavor oscillation is not predicted by the \gls{SM}, and it predicts their mass to be zero, which has been experimentally disproven \cite{neutrino-oscillation}. The matter-antimatter asymmetry is not addressed by the \gls{SM}. Nevertheless, it remains the most accurate theory of describing particle physics.}, successfully predicting the top quark \cite{top-quark}, tau neutrino \cite{tau-neutrino}, and Higgs boson \cite{higgs-discovery-atlas,higgs-discovery-cms}.
    

    \section{The Standard Model}

        % todo figure out where to put this        
        The standard model Lagrangian is given by:

        \begin{equation}
            \begin{aligned}
                \mathcal{L} &= - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} \\
                &=+ i \bar{\psi} \cancel{D} \psi + h.c. \\
                &=+ \bar{\psi}_i y_{ij} \psi_j \phi + h.c. \\
                &=+ |D_\mu \phi|^2 - V(\phi)
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}

        Where the first term describes the strong for the gluon and the strong nuclear force, the second describes the weak nuclear force along with the W and Z bosons... 




        \subsection{Fermions}
        Fermions are spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles which obey the Pauli Exclusion principle, and thus take up space and make up matter. Within the \gls{SM}, there are two types of fermions, quarks and leptons. Each of these can be broken down into three generations of particles.

        \noindent{\textbf{Quarks}}\\
        \indent Quarks are fermions which combine to form hadrons. Quarks have several properties:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Flavor - There are 6 flavors of quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), and top (t) (from lightest to heaviest). Each particle also has a corresponding anti-particle: anti-up ($\bar{u}$), anti-down ($\bar{d}$), etc. These are used to arrange the quarks into generations, shown in Table \ref{tab:fermions}.
            \item Electric Charge - Quarks either have charge of $\frac{2}{3}$ (up, charm, top) or $-\frac{1}{3}$ (down, strange, bottom), while anti-quarks have the opposite charge. 
            \item Color Charge - Each quark has a degree of freedom known as color charge, which can be ``red,'' ``blue,'' or ``green,'' as well as a corresponding anti-color. Color charge is a product of \gls{QCD}, discussed in section \ref{sssec:QCD}, which has a distinct property that particles with color charge cannot be isolated, and must form bound states. This feature is known as \textit{color confinement}. Bound states require a colorless configuration, which may be achieved either through a color-anticolor combination known as mesons, or a (anti)-RGB triplet known as (anti)-baryons. 
        \end{itemize}

        \noindent{\textbf{Leptons}}\\
        \indent The remaining fermions are known as leptons, which differ from quarks in that they do not strongly interact. Each lepton generation contains one charged particle and a neutral counterpart, known as a neutrino. The charged leptons are the electron, muon, and tau (from lightest to heaviest). Table \ref{tab:fermions} also lists the leptons and neutrinos by generation as well as their masses. Each lepton has an associated antilepton as well: the positron, antimuon, and antitau, as well as their antineutrinos. The properties of the antilepton match their corresponding lepton exactly, except the electric charge and lepton number have opposite sign. Lepton number is a conserved quantity in particle interactions and is +1 for all standard leptons, -1 for all antileptons.

        Generally, the wave function of a fermion is given by $\psi(x)$, and is a spinor of four components. The motion is described by the relativistic version of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation known as the Dirac equation, given as
        \begin{equation} \label{eqn:dirac}
            (i\gamma'^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}-m)\Psi' = 0
        \end{equation}

        \subsection{Interactions}

        In nature, there are four fundamental forces describing interactions: the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, the electromagnetic force, and the gravitational force. The \gls{SM} models the former three of these forces\footnote{The gravitational force is not modeled by the \gls{SM}. It has relative strength of $10^{-37}$ at $\unit{1}{fm}$. In theories of quantum gravity, it is mediated by the ``graviton'' ($G$), a massless spin-2 particle.}, describing each via a \gls{QFT} corresponding to the exchange of a gauge boson, a particle carrying integer spin that does not obey the Pauli Exclusion principle. A broad summary of the forces and their associated \glspl{QFT} can be found in Table \ref{tab:forces}, and the following sections will describe the various theories relating to each particle interaction.

        \begin{table}[!ht]
            \begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l}

            \label{tab:forces}
        \end{table}


        \subsubsection{Quantum Electrodynamics}

        The Dirac equation, Equation \ref{eqn:dirac}, is not gauge invariant. Meaning, performing a local gauge transformation on fermions (denoted by $\psi$)
        %
        \begin{equation} \label{eqn:gauge-transform}
            \psi(x) \rightarrow e^{-i\theta(x)}\psi(x),
        \end{equation}        
        %
        for real-valued function $\theta(x)$, transforms the Lagrangian as:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{L} \rightarrow \mathcal{L} - (\partial_{\mu}\theta)\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\psi.
        \end{equation}
        %
        To impose gauge invariance, a vector field can be introduced, transforming like
        \begin{equation}
            A_{\mu}(x) \rightarrow A_{\mu}(x) + \partial_{\mu}\theta(x),
        \end{equation}
        %
        with covariant derivative
        \begin{equation}
            D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} + iqA_{\mu}.
        \end{equation}
        %
        This massless vector field corresponds to the electromagnetic field, and the covariant derivative describes the minimal coupling of the photon, its quanta, to fermions. Applying this vector field to the Dirac Lagrangian gives the \gls{QED} Lagrangian,
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{L}_{QED} = \bar{\psi} (i \gamma^{\mu} D_{\mu} - m)\psi - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu \nu}F^{\mu \nu}
        \end{equation}
        %
        With $F_{\mu \nu}$, the electromagnetic field tensor, as:
        \begin{equation}
        F_{\mu \nu} = \partial_{\mu}A_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}A_{\mu}
        \end{equation}
        %
        By construction, the \gls{QED} Lagrangian is gauge invariant, and symmetric under the transformation described in \ref{eqn:gauge-transform}. This transformation is equivalently thought of as multiplication by a unitary $1 \times 1$ matrix of the $U(1)$ group, meaning \gls{QED} is symmetric under $U(1)$.


        \subsubsection{Quantum Chromodynamics} \label{sssec:QCD}

        \gls{QCD} is the \gls{QFT} corresponding to the strong nuclear interaction, predicting how quarks and gluons interact. While \gls{QED} corresponded to a $U(1)$ local gauge symmetry, \gls{QCD} corresponds to a $SU(3)$ gauge group, where quarks transform in the fundamental {\bf 3} representation. This representation has eight $3 \times 3$ generators, corresponding to eight gluons, the mediator of the strong force. The dimensionality of the generators mean the wave function has three additional degrees of freedom known as color. Taking the convention of denoting these as ``red'' (r), ``green'' (g), and ``blue'' (b), we can denote quarks, $\psi$ as a vector:
        \begin{equation}
            \psi =\begin{pmatrix} \psi_{r} \\ \psi_{b} \\ \psi_{g}\end{pmatrix},
        \end{equation}
        %
        making a gauge transformation
        \begin{equation}
        \psi \rightarrow e^{i\theta}e^{-ig {\boldsymbol \lambda\cdot \phi}}\psi.
        \end{equation}
        %
        %todo - clear this up a bit, look at martins notes
        Here $\boldsymbol \lambda$ are the eight Gell-Mann matrices, while ${\boldsymbol \phi} = {\boldsymbol a}/g$ for vector of length 8 $\boldsymbol a$ and strong coupling constant g. This corresponds to the $SU(3)_C$ group ($C$ indicates ``color'').

        In order to achieve invariance under said transformation, we substitute the derivative in the Dirac equation by the covariant derivative 
        \begin{equation}
            D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} + ig {\boldsymbol \lambda\cdot G_{\mu}}.
        \end{equation}
        %
        In this, ${G_{mu}}$ are eight fields, corresponding to eight gluons with various color charge, the mediator of the strong force.

        This makes the \gls{QCD} Lagrangian
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{L}_{QCD} = \bar{\psi}^j (i \gamma^{\mu} D_{\mu}^{jk} - m^{jk})\psi^{k} - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu \nu}^{a} F^{\mu \nu}_{a},
        \end{equation}
        %
        for mass $m$, indices j and k taking values 1 to 3, and gluon field tensor $F_{\mu \nu}$, given as
        \begin{equation}
            F^{\mu \nu}_{a} = \partial_{\mu} G_{\nu}^a - \partial_{\nu}G_{\mu}^a - g f^{abc} \lambda^a G_{\mu}^b G_{\nu}^c.
        \end{equation}
        %        
        Here $f_{abc}$ are the structure constants associated with the $SU(3)$ group, and indices $a,b,c$ represent the gluons, running from values 1 to 8. Of special note, this tensor contains triplet and quartic gluon self-coupling, a product of the gluon color charge.


        \subsubsection{Electroweak Interaction}

        In the \gls{SM}, the weak and electromagnetic interactions are interpreted as manifestations of a single force. This unification occurs at energies above $\unit{100}{\GeV}$ and is known as the electroweak force.

        Electroweak interactions have four mediators, the $W^{\pm}$, $Z$, and $\gamma$, and subsequently four generators prior to spontaneous symmetry breaking. After symmetry breaking, the gauge group must be electromagnetically gauge invariant. The \gls{SM} of electroweak interactions by Glashow, Weinberg, and Salam {\color{red} cite} contains symmetry breaking:
        \begin{equation}
            SU(2) \times U(1) \rightarrow U(1)_{EM}.
        \end{equation}
        The $SU(2)$ subgroup is weak isospin, where left-handed fermions are doublets, and right-handed fermions are all singlets. The $U(1)$ subgroup is weak hypercharge with coupling constant $g'$. Weak hypercharge ($Y$) is a conserved quantity.

\section{The Higgs Field and Higgs Boson}

To spontaneously break this electroweak gauge symmetry, a complex $SU(2)$ doublet scalar field is introduced

\begin{equation}
\phi = \begin{pmatrix} \phi^+ \\ \phi^0 \end{pmatrix}
    = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}
        \phi_1 + i\phi_2 \\ \phi_3 + i\phi_4
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The corresponding gauge-invariant potential is 

\begin{equation}
    V(\phi,\phi^\dagger) = m^2 \phi^\dagger \phi + \lambda (\phi^\dagger \phi)^2,
\end{equation}

with corresponding Lagrangian density
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = (\partial_{\mu}\phi)^\dagger (\partial^{\mu}\phi) - V(\phi).
\end{equation}

The minima of this potential is known as the vacuum state, and for this minima to be finite, $\lambda$ must be greater than 0. For $\mu^2 >0$, the minima is located at 0, however, for $\mu^2<0$, the potential has minima at:


\begin{equation}
    \phi^\dagger \phi = \frac{v^2}{2},
\end{equation}

where 
\begin{equation}
    v = \sqrt{-m^2 / \lambda}.
\end{equation}

%% TODO: Working from martin's book, connect these


Here, $v$ is known as the \glsfirst{vev}. 

This formulation predicts the W and Z boson masses:

\begin{equation}
    m^2_W = \frac{g^2 v^2}{4}, \hspace{1cm} m^2_Z = \frac{(g^2 +g'^2)v^2}{4}
\end{equation}

which agrees with experimental values when the \gls{vev} is $\unit{246}{\GeV}$.


In unitarity gauge, the Higgs potential takes the form:
\begin{equation}
    V(h) = \lambda v^2 h^2 + \lambda v h^3 + \frac{\lambda}{4}h^4,
\end{equation}

indicating self-interactions with the Higgs boson. The second term gives rise to the trilinear coupling, while the third indicates the Higgs quartic coupling. The mass can also be derived as $m_h = \sqrt{2\lambda}v$. 


%%%%%%%%
The minimal Higgs model has two complex scalar fields, which are placed in a weak isospin doublet

\begin{equation}
\phi = \begin{pmatrix} \phi^+ \\ \phi^0 \end{pmatrix}
    = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}
        \phi_1 + i\phi_2 \\ \phi_3 + i\phi_4
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

With corresponding Lagrangian

\begin{equation} \label{higgs-lagrangian}
    \mathcal{L} = (\partial_{\mu}\phi)^\dagger (\partial^{\mu}\phi) - V(\phi)\\
\end{equation}

And potential,

\begin{equation} \label{higgs-potential}
    V(\phi) = \mu^2\phi^\dagger \phi - \lambda(\phi^\dagger \phi)^2
\end{equation}

The minima of this potential is known as the vacuum state, and for this minima to be finite, $\lambda$ must be greater than 0. For $\mu^2 >0$, the minima is located at 0, however, for $\mu^2<0$, the potential has minima at:

\begin{equation}
    \phi^\dagger \phi = \frac{1}{2}(\phi_{1}^{2}+\phi_{2}^{2}+\phi_{3}^{2}+\phi_{4}^{2}) = \frac{v^2}{2} = -\frac{\mu^2}{2\lambda}
\end{equation}

This value is known as the \glsfirst{vev}. When $\mu^2 < 0$, this value is non-zero, and due to symmetry has two degenerate states. By choosing state, the Lagrangian symmetry is broken, known as spontaneous symmetry breaking.

\section{Di-Higgs Production}

For the Higgs mechanism described, in order to understand Electroweak Symmetry Breaking, study of the trilinear and quartic couplings is paramount. For a direct probe\footnote{Through loop corrections, mono-Higgs searches can provide an indirect handle on the trilinear coupling. ATLAS has published one such analysis with $\unit{80}{\invfb}$, found in Reference \cite{monohiggs-selfcoupling}. When making the assumption that all other Higgs couplings are as predicted by the \gls{SM}, this analysis finds the observed (expected) $95\%$ C.L. interval on the trilinear coupling to be $-3.2 < \kappa_\lambda <11.9$   $(-6.2 < \kappa_\lambda <14.4)$. }, production modes resulting in pair and triplet Higgs production must be studied. The cross-section of such production modes, however, is quite small. Triplet production of Higgs bosons occurs at a rate 6 orders of magnitude less frequently than mono-Higgs production, and is not feasible to study at the \gls{LHC}. Pair production is 3 orders of magnitude more rare than mono-Higgs production, but over the full \gls{LHC} lifetime, a handle on the trilinear self-coupling may be achievable.

The analysis presented in this thesis is one such search for di-Higgs production, specifically where one of the produced Higgs bosons decays to a pair of photons, and the other to a $b\bar{b}$ pair.

\subsection{Production in the Standard Model}
In the standard model, several production modes pair produce Higgs bosons. \gls{ggF} is the most dominant with a cross-section accounting for over $90\%$ of di-Higgs production, described in section \ref{sssec:ggfHH}. The next most dominant is Vector Boson Fusion, which is responsible for just over $5\%$ of di-Higgs production and is described in section \ref{sssec:vbfHH}. The remaining production modes, $VHH$, $ttHH$, and $tjHH$ collectively comprise less than 5\% of di-Higgs production, and have a cross-section too small to make a meaningful contribution to the proposed analysis.

\subsubsection{Gluon-Gluon Fusion} \label{sssec:ggfHH}

The predominant di-Higgs production mode is \gls{ggF}, in which the production is mediated by a quark loop. In the \gls{SM}, this proceeds through two diagrams at tree level, where the quark loop either forms a box or a triangle. The former directly pair produces two Higgs bosons while the latter pair produces via a virtual Higgs boson, making it sensitive to the Higgs self-coupling, $\lambda_{HHH}$. These two diagrams are destructively interfering. QCD corrections to this process are known to \gls{NLO}, and can double the cross-section from the \gls{LO} value. \gls{NNLO} corrections are known in the large top mass limit and represent a $\sim 20\%$ increase from the \gls{NLO} prediction. At $\unit{13}{\TeV}$, the cross-section for \gls{ggF} production is $31.05^{+2.2\%}_{-5.0\%} \pm 3.0\%$\footnote{The first (upper and lower) uncertainties refer to scale uncertainties, the second is PDF + $\alpha_s$ uncertainty.}  \cite{hh-crosssections}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Vector Boson Fusion} \label{sssec:vbfHH}
The second-most dominant $HH$ production mode is \gls{VBF} ($qq \rightarrow HHqq$), in which two quarks scatter via the exchange of a virtual vector boson, $W$ or $Z$ (generally denoted $V$), and from that boson, a di-Higgs system is produced. This proceeds via three Feynman diagrams at tree level, shown in Figure \ref{fig:vbf_feyn}. At $\unit{13}{\TeV}$, the cross-section for \gls{VBF} production is $1.73^{+0.03\%}_{-0/04\%} \pm 2.1\%$\cite{hh-crosssections}.

The effective Lagrangian for this process (assuming couplings of the Higgs boson to \gls{SM} fermions scale with their masses and do not violate flavor) can be parameterized as 

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{L} \supset &\frac{1}{2}(\partial_{\mu} h)^2 -V(h) + \frac{v^2}{4} Tr(D_{\mu}\Sigma^\dagger D^\mu \Sigma) [1 + 2c_{V} \frac{h}{v} + c_{2V} \frac{h^2}{v^2} + ...] \\
     &- m_i\bar{\psi}_{Li}\Sigma(1+c_{\psi}\frac{h}{v}+...)\psi_{Ri} + h.c.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
for Higgs potential,
\begin{equation}
    V(h) = \frac{1}{2}m_h^2h^2 +c_3 \frac{1}{6}\bigg(\frac{3m_h^2}{v}\bigg)h^3 + c_4 \frac{1}{24}\bigg(\frac{3m_h^2}{v^2}\bigg)h^4+...
\end{equation}
The coefficients $c_V$, $c_{2V}$, and $c_3$ indicate three different coupling strengths \cite{vbfhh}. The vertex denoted $c_V$ is the interaction between two vector bosons and a Higgs boson (occasionally denoted $hVV$). This vertex has strong constraints from \gls{SM} mono-Higgs analyses {\color{red} cite}. The vertex denoted $\kappa_{\lambda}$ is again the Higgs trilinear coupling, meaning that the \gls{VBF} production mode offers sensitivity to this vertex as well. Phenomenology studies at parton level have shown the sensitivity in the \gls{VBF} mode to provide a competitive handle on $\kappa_{\lambda}$ \cite{vbf_lambda}. The vertex denoted $c_{2V}$ is the interaction between two vector bosons and two Higgs bosons (also denoted $hhVV$). \gls{VBF} $HH$ searches offer a unique handle on this vertex, previously entirely unconstrained.

% TODO: Maybe this goes in analysis?
Despite the low cross-section of \gls{VBF} production, the unique kinematics make the channel appealing for searches. The diphoton \gls{VBF} channel was one included in the 2012 Higgs discovery. Notably, the \gls{VBF} quarks yield a high $m_{jj}$ system and are largely separated in $\eta$. The kinematics of \gls{VBF} di-Higgs production are similar to that of mono-Higgs. The major difference is that mono-Higgs searches take advantage of the low central jet activity by applying a veto. In $HH \rightarrow \gamma \gamma b\bar{b}$, however, the $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ system causes central jet activity, making such a veto impossible.


\subsection{Production Beyond the Standard Model}

Due to the small cross-section of $HH$ production, the LHC does not have sensitivity to \gls{SM} production. An enhancement to the cross-section, however, may be noticeable with the current data set and would indicate the presence of physics beyond the standard model. There are a variety of scenarios in which this could occur, both through a resonance and through non-resonant enhancements.

\subsubsection{Non-Resonant BSM Production}

Non-resonant enhancements to the $HH$ cross-section could occur through two major routes: deviations in couplings from \gls{SM} value, or the presence of couplings not predicted by the \gls{SM}.

\noindent{${\boldsymbol \kappa_{\lambda}}$}\\
\indent Enhancements to the Higgs trilinear coupling

\noindent{${\boldsymbol c_{2V}}$}\\
\indent The \gls{VBF} $HH$ production mode offers sensitivity to the $hhVV$ vertex, and any deviations from \gls{SM} expectations for this coupling would lead to an enhancement in the $HH$ cross-section.

\subsubsection{Resonant BSM Production}

Several \gls{BSM} theories predict particles that would decay to a pair of Higgs bosons, which would result in a resonant enhancement to the $HH$ cross-section. Notably, two Higgs doublet models extend the Higgs sector with the presence of a heavy scalar doublet \cite{THDM}. Among these models are the minimal supersymmetric extension of the \gls{SM} \cite{mssm}, twin Higgs models, and composite Higgs models \cite{compositeHiggs}.

\end{figure}

\noindent\textbf{VBF}\\
\indent Similarly to the searches for resonant ggF Higgs boson pair production, \gls{VBF} $HH$
production involving an intermediate resonance may be considered. This kind of search would be complementary to the ggF searches, as in this case the vector bosons are the ones coupling to the new resonance, which then decays to a pair of Higgs bosons, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:vbf-resonant}. However, this production mode is not
particularly well studied (Reference \cite{res_vbf} presents an analysis in the context of a model with warped extra dimensions), since its very small cross section poses a question on the ability of the LHC to impose significant constraints through this type of search.
