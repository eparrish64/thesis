This dissertation uses 139 \ifb of \pp collision data collected at a center of mass energy of \sqs by the ATLAS detector to search for charged Higgs bosons decaying to a tau lepton and a neutrino (\HpmLong) in association with a top quark. Two subchannels are defined based on the leptonic decay (\taulep) or hadronic decay (\taujets) of the associated top quark. \acrlongpl{PNN} are investigated and optimized to improve signal separation from background in both subchannels across a wide \mHpm range of 80 GeV to 3000 GeV. Expected exclusion limits at 95\% confidence on $\sigma(\pp \to tb\Hpm)\times \mathrm{\cal{B}}(\Hpm \to \tau \nu)$ are compared to previous observed limits.

% No significant excess was found, therefore limits are set at the 95\% confidence level on the charged Higgs production cross section times the branching fraction into the \taunu ranging from XX pb to XX fb. These limits are interpreted in the hMSSM benchmark scenario as an exclusion at 95\% confidence on \tanb as a function of \mHpm. 

% In this scenario, for $\tanb=60$, the \Hpm mass range up to $XXX$ GeV is excluded, with all values of \tanb excluded for $\mHpm \leq XXX$ GeV.
