This dissertation presents a search for resonant and non-resonant di-Higgs production in the $\gamma \gamma b \bar{b}$ final state using data from the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  The search is performed on 36.1 \ifb of data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ \TeV collected in 2015 and 2016.

No significant excesses are observed in this search. The non-resonant analysis sets limits on the $\hh\rightarrow\yybb$ \xsec times branching ratio, with an upper observed (expected) limit of 0.73 (0.93) pb. The observed (expected) limits on the Higgs boson trilinear coupling at 95\% \gls{CL} are set at $-8.2 < \klambda < 13.3$ ($-8.5 < \klambda < 13.7$). A resonant search is also presented, setting limits on a generic scalar resonance between 260 and 1000 GeV under the narrow-width approximation. These  limits cover mass hypotheses ranging from 260 GeV to 1000 GeV, and the observed (expected) limits set are 0.85 (0.92) pb at the lowest mass hypothesis to 0.13 (0.15) pb at the highest mass hypothesis.

Work toward the future of this analysis is presented. Improvements in photon identification are studied, optimizing the photon identification menu through two approaches. First, adding new discriminating variables through the addition of topological cluster moments, which provide an improvement of as much as 12\% in background rejection for the same signal efficiency as the current tight identification. Second, using a multivariate approach to define photon identification is presented, and an improvement of up to 22\% background rejection is shown through implementation of a \pt-inclusively trained Boosted Decision Tree (BDT). Through all of these optimizations an improvement of Z is shown.

Additionally, improvements to the analysis through the addition of a signal region targeting Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) production are shown. A multiclass BDT is used, with classes to model the VBF \hh production mode, along with gluon-gluon fusion \hh production, as well as the dominant \yy-continuum background, and $ttH$ mono-Higgs background. By adding this signal region, a 9.7\% improvement in Asimov significance is achieved using the full 140 \ifb of \RunTwo data.
