This dissertation uses 139 \ifb of \pp collision data collected at a center of mass energy of \sqs by the ATLAS detector to search for charged Higgs bosons decaying to a tau lepton and a neutrino (\HpLong) in association with a leptonically decaying top quark. No significant excess was found, therefore limits are set at the 95\% confidence level on the charged Higgs production cross section times the branching fraction into the \taunu ranging from XX pb to XX fb. These limits are interpreted in the hMSSM benchmark scenario as an exclusion at 95\% confidence on \tanb as a function of \mHp. In this scenario, for $\tanb=60$, the \Hp mass range up to $\unit{XXXX}{GeV}$ is excluded, with all values of \tanb excluded for $\mHp \leq \unit{XXX}{GeV}$
