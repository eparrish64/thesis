\chapter{The LHC and ATLAS Experiment}

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}{
	\textcolor{red}{NEEDS TO BE DONE}
}
	In order to study the Standard Model,the Higgs boson, and hints of new physics, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was built outside of Geneva, Switzerland. At 27 km in circumference with a center of mass energy of 13.6 TeV, the LHC is the largest and highest energy particle accelerator ever built. It consists of \textcolor{red}{###} magnet sectors split between dipole and quadrupole magnets.
