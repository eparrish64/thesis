\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusions}
	The \acrlong{SM} is an incredibly accurate model of fundamental particle physics, but is ultimately incomplete. There are many possible extensions to the \acrlong{SM}; this dissertation covers a search for a charged Higgs boson in the \HpmLong final state within the \acrfull{2HDM} theory. 

	The search consists of two subchannels based on the decay of the associated top quark; \taulep for the leptonic decay channel and \taujets for the hadronic decay channel. \acrlongpl{PNN} were investigated and optimized to separate signal from background in the \acrlongpl{SR}. Assuming a result consistent with the \gls{SM} expected results are shown compared to previously observed results showing an improvement of $\simeq 3\times$. At the time of writing, the final unblinding procedure within the \gls{ATLAS} collaboration is underway.
