\chapter{Event Reconstruction}\label{chap:reco}
	Before any physics analysis can be performed on the raw data from the ATLAS detector and MC simulations both raw datasets go through a reconstruction software suite called Athena. Various algorithms are employed to identify energy deposits as particles based on shower shapes, track hits, calculated charge to mass ratios, etc. The following sections detail the identification processes of muons, electrons, photons, jets, $\tau$ leptons, and a calculated quantity called missing transverse energy $(\Etm)$.
